## Description

This program allow you to execute query directly on the server

1. Write your query in the editor window (ABAP SQL)
2. View the result in ALV window (in case of SELECT query)

Features :
The top center pane allow you to write your query in ABAP SQL format.
Query can be complex with JOIN, UNION and subqueries. You can write
query on several lines. You could also add spaces.
To add comment, start the line by * or prefix your comment by "

You could write several queries in the query editor, separated by
dot ".". To execute one of them, highlight all the wanted query,
or just put the cursor anywhere inside the wanted query.
By default, the last query is executed.

In case of error, you can display generated code to help you to
correct your query (only if you have S_DEVELOP access)

F1 Help is managed to help you on ABAP SQL Syntax
Code completion is also available :

- TAB to autocomplete with tooltip word
- CTRL + ESPACE to display list of available words
Be carefull to not use with INSERT statement (see below)

The top left pane allow you to store your query :

- You could save your query to reuse it later
- You could share your query : define users, usergroup, all
- You could export query into file to reuse it on another server

The top right pane display ddic object that is currently used to help
you to write the proper query
Synergy with ZSPRO program : display tables defined in ZSPRO in the
ddic tree
Tips : You can search a table in the tree using header clic

Managed queries  
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, Any native SQL command

About New SQL Query Syntax
You could use new syntax (if your SAP system manage it)
ZTOAD autmatically detect if you are using new sytax when:

- You separated your selected fields with comma
- You prefixed your variable with @ in the INTO TABLE statement

Select Clause managed  
SELECT [DISTINCT / SINGLE] select clause  
FROM from clause  
[UP TO x ROWS]  
[WHERE cond1]  
[GROUP BY fields1]  
[HAVING cond2]  
[ORDER BY fields2]  
[UNION SELECT...]  

UP TO (Default max rows) ROWS added at end of query if omitted
You could force select without limits by adding UP TO 0 ROWS

COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN, SUM are managed  
DO NOT FORGET SPACE in ( ) of aggregat  

Insert special syntax
In ABAP, insert query is always used with given structure
In this SQL editor, you have 2 ways to do an INSERT :

- By passing each value, 1 by 1  
`INSERT SEOCLASSTX VALUES ( 'ZZMACLASS', ' ', 'Test claSS' )`

- By passing value of used fields only  
`INSERT SEOCLASSTX SET CLSNAME = 'ZZMACLASS' DESCRIPT = 'TeSt class'`

Native SQL special syntax
To execute a native SQL command, please add the prefix NATIVE
before your query
`NATIVE CREATE INDEX 'TESTINDEX' ON T001 (MANDT, WAERS, BUKRS)`
`NATIVE DROP INDEX 'TESTINDEX'`

## Sample queries

`SELECT SINGLE * FROM VBAP WHERE VBELN = '00412345678'`

`SELECT COUNT( * ) SUBC MAX( PROG ) FROM TRDIR GROUP BY SUBC`

`SELECT VBAK~* from VBAK UP TO 3 ROWS ORDER BY VKORG.`

`SELECT T1~VBELN T2~POSNR FROM VBAk AS T1`
       `JOIN VBAP AS T2 ON T1~VBELN = T2~VBELN`

`INSERT SEOCLASSTX VALUES ( 'ZZMACLASS', ' ', 'Test claSS' )`

`INSERT SEOCLASSTX SET CLSNAME = 'ZZMACLASS' DESCRIPT = 'TeSt class'`

`UPDATE SEOCLASSTX SET DESCRIPT = 'txt' WHERE CLSNAME = 'ZZMACLASS'`

`DELETE SEOCLASSTX WHERE CLSNAME = 'ZZMACLASS'`

## Add Authorization

You could define your authorization object to restrict function usage by user.  
If you dont define auth object, all users will have same access as defined bellow.  
The auth object have 2 fields TABLE and ACTVT  
ACTVT can take 5 values that you could define here.  
By default :

- 01 for INSERT command
- 02 for UPDATE command
- 03 for SELECT command
- 06 for DELETE command
- 16 for EXECUTE NATIVE SQL command
- TABLE contain allowed table name pattern

The Authorization object name ist `ZTOAD_AUTH`.
